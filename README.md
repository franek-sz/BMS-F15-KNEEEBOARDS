# ✈️ Falcon BMS Kneeboards Script

This script is designed to transfer F-16 kneeboards to the F-15.

---

1. Place the scipt in the textures directory.

2. Create WDP kneeboards for a mission.

3. Run the script.

---

## Notes

- Since WDP is no longer supported, it's impossible to create kneeboards for the F-15 in the WDP, this script is taking the F-16 kneeboard textures and overwrites the F-15 ones.
- There will be both F-15 and F-16 checklists on the kneeboard in the game.
